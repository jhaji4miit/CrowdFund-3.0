# üèóÔ∏è CrowdFund Smart Contract

An advanced decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built with Solidity. It allows users to contribute ETH toward a funding goal, tracks all contributors, and includes rich features like deadline extension, refunds, campaign resets, contributor stats, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- Secure Contributions: Users can contribute securely using Ethereum (ETH).
- Real-time Campaign Tracking: Real-time updates on campaign progress.
- Ownership and Management: Owner can manage the campaign, extend deadlines, withdraw funds, and reset campaigns.
- Refund Mechanism: Contributors can claim refunds if the funding goal is not achieved.

## Smart Contract Features

- Contribution tracking and event logging.
- Campaign state tracking (active, reached goal, withdrawn funds).
- Ownership transfer and campaign management.

## üß† Tech Stack

- **Solidity (v0.8.x)**
- **Hardhat**
- **ETH** (for contributions)
- **Events** for all key actions

üü¢ Public Functions (User & Owner)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Reentrancy safe: funds are set to zero before transfer.
- OnlyOwner modifiers restrict critical functions.
- Checks and conditions guard deadlines, contribution state, and withdrawals.
- No external dependencies (e.g., OpenZeppelin) for lightweight deployment.


## üìà Future Enhancements

- Multi-campaign support
- NFT-based contribution rewards
- Off-chain metadata using IPFS
- Integration with frontend DApp UI (React/Vanilla)
- Leaderboards & badges for contributors
