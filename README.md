## üì¢ CrowdFund - A Unique Smart Contract for Crowdfunding Campaigns

## üìñ Project Description
CrowdFund is a decentralized and transparent crowdfunding smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to contribute ETH to fund a project within a set deadline. If the funding goal is reached, the campaign owner can withdraw the funds. Otherwise, contributors can claim refunds.

This contract ensures fairness, trustlessness, and security by handling all fund operations through smart contract logic, eliminating the need for any centralized third party.

## üåü Project Vision
Our vision is to create a fully decentralized crowdfunding platform where project creators and backers can interact without intermediaries, while maintaining transparency, security, and community-driven funding practices.

The ultimate goal is to make fundraising accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world, powered by blockchain technology.

## ‚ú® Key Features
Owner Deployment: Only the contract owner can set up a funding campaign.
Contributions: Any Ethereum address can contribute ETH before the campaign deadline.
Funding Goal Monitoring: Automatically checks when the funding goal is reached.
Secure Withdrawal: Owner can withdraw only after a successful campaign.
Refund Mechanism: Contributors can get refunds automatically if the campaign fails.
Deadline Extension: Owner can extend the deadline one time if more time is needed.
Contributor Tracking: Maintains a list of unique contributors.
Campaign Summary: Provides a quick overview of the campaign's status.
Immutable Rules: Once deployed, no one can alter the funding goal or core logic.
