# üèóÔ∏è CrowdFund Smart Contract

An advanced decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built with Solidity. It allows users to contribute ETH toward a funding goal, tracks all contributors, and includes rich features like deadline extension, refunds, campaign resets, contributor stats, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts ETH contributions with goal tracking.
- Automatically detects goal completion.
- Owner can withdraw funds if goal is met.
- Contributors can get refunds if the goal isn‚Äôt reached.
- Owner can extend campaign deadline (once).
- Tracks each contributor and their amount.
- Campaign can be reset for a new round.
- Contributor stats: top, average, count, minimum.
- Percentage share of each contributor.
- Public campaign status messages.
- Ownership transfer support.

## üß† Tech Stack

- **Solidity (v0.8.x)**
- **Hardhat**
- **ETH** (for contributions)
- **Events** for all key actions

üü¢ Public Functions (User & Owner)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Reentrancy safe: funds are set to zero before transfer.
- OnlyOwner modifiers restrict critical functions.
- Checks and conditions guard deadlines, contribution state, and withdrawals.
- No external dependencies (e.g., OpenZeppelin) for lightweight deployment.


## üìà Future Enhancements

- Multi-campaign support
- NFT-based contribution rewards
- Off-chain metadata using IPFS
- Integration with frontend DApp UI (React/Vanilla)
- Leaderboards & badges for contributors
