Crowdfund3.0 | Empowering Decentralized Dreams

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
Crowdfund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Core DAO blockchain.
It provides a transparent, secure, and efficient way for project creators to raise funds and for supporters to invest in ideas they believe in â€” with no middlemen involved.
